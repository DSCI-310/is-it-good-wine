# DSCI 310: Group 11 Team Contract
Anthony, Christina, and Justin

### Expectations
* What are the expected work hours for the project?
* What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?

The group expects to attribute roughly 4 hours of work per week on this project including meetings and individual working time - with more time being attributed closer to deadlines if work needs to be completed. We expect to have a working DSCI project (all functions run on all computers, reproducible, etc.) by the end of the term.

### Scheduling & Meeting Etiquette
* How often will group meetings occur (here is a nice article on meetings)?
* Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?
* When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).

Group should meet at least once one week. Group members should also check the group chat at least once a day. When due dates are closed the meeting frequency is expected to increase. 

The group will create a collaborative meeting agenda before meetings to keep meetings focused and productive. There will be a designated notetaker for each meeting to keep track of new tasks and key things discussed during the meeting.

1. Justin: 9-5 throughout the week, but flexible if we need to have emergency meetings
2. Anthony: Not available in person on Wednesday. Flexible if there is emergent situations.
3. Christina: 

### Communication & Working Style
* What will be the style of working?
* How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?
  * Will you start each day with stand-ups, or submit a summary of your contributions 4 hours before each meeting? or something else?

The group will meet and discuss deliverables and tasks. Members will then go work through tasks individually, reaching out in the slack group chat if they need help. If there are any glaring issues or conflicts that are too big to resolve through the group chat, we will schedule a time throughout the week to meet in-person/virtually to work through the issues together.

Each group member will be assigned to specific tasks during the initial discussion before starting on each part of project. Tasks can be assigned based on each memberâ€™s interest, but each member needs to have a consensus on the task assignments to make sure no one is working too much.  

If a group member is struggling with the quality or completion of their assigned tasks, they should reach out to the others before the last 12 hours before deliverable submissions to ensure that there is enough time to collaborate and solve problems together.
