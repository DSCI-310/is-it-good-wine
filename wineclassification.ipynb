    "As one of the most popular drinks in the world,  wine has historically and continues to hold an important role in society. According to Ritchie and Roser, the consumption of wine is growing significantly since 1960.  Specifically, Canadian on average consumed  0.3 liters of wine in 1964, and the consumption grows to 2.1 liters of wine in 2019 [@Ritchie2018]. As the demand of wine grows rapidly, more and more wine companies begin to focus on improve the wine quality in order to attracts consumers and make more profit. However, due to complexity of wine production process, a sophisticated  way to predict wine quality is still rare. Furthermore, recent research done by Filipe-Ribeiro et. al suggested that certain chemical ingredients are found correlated to wine quality [-@Filipe-Ribeiro2017]. **Therefore, this project will examine the relationship between chemical ingredients and the quality of wine, and attempted to answer the question of whether wine can be classified as 'good' or 'bad' based on its chemical ingredients.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use the red wine dataset collected from UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). This dataset contains 1599 observations, and 12 variables shown as follow:  \n",

    ">1 - fixed acidity\n",

    "<br>8 - density\n",
    "<br>9 - pH\n",
    "<br>10 - sulphates\n",
    "<br>11 - alcohol\n",
    "<br>12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n",

    "In machine learning, model selection plays a critical role in achieving the best performance on a given task. As our task involves classifying wines as 'good' or 'bad' based on their chemical properties, we will proceed with the four classification models to predict the outcomes of our wine data set. to predict the outcomes of our wine dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "- SVM with RBF kernel \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of these models (i.e. each model's accuracy in classification) will assist us in determining whether our 11 feature values (subtracting the 'quality' metric) can be accurate predictors for classifying wines as 'good' or 'bad', or if there are other factors at play. A baseline model will also be included as a point of comparison for all the other machine learning models used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our quality classification, the input features are chemical composition of wine samples: such as alcohol content, fixed acidity, chlorides, sulphates, etc. The output label is derived from the *quality* rating assigned to each wine sample (sourced from various wine critics). If the quality score greater than 5, it is classified as 'good' - whereas below 5 results in a 'bad' classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we split the data into separate train (0.80) and test set (0.20) to help us evaluate the performance of a model. We utilize the training data to expose the model to the dataset, and test the model's ability to predict the 'target' value of our test data. This provides an estimate of how well the model will generalize to data that we have not seen yet."

While Random Forest Classifiers are more complex and may achieve higher accuracy scores on large datasets, it may not be the best option for small datasets. Random Forest requires a large number of samples and features to achieve good performance. With a small dataset like our wine set, Random Forest may overfit the training data and fail to generalize well on unseen data. Moreover, the computational cost of training and testing a Random Forest can be much higher than a simple Decision Tree, especially with limited computational resources.\n",

    "Our trained models all performed better than the baseline model, but a best score of 0.75 is not sufficient to accurately predict wine quality based on its chemical qualities. While the lower accuracy score is not ideal, it is expected. Errors in the predictions may be due to the limitations of the methods used; however, it is likely also due to the varying preferences of the individuals surveyed to obtain the data. Limitations of the models used have been previously mentioned in the methods section, so this section will focus on human biases. The standards and qualities of wine are all determined by people and even though there may be experts that know the field, quality is still a subjective measurement and experts will still have bias in their judgments. As noted in the paper by Cortez et al, sensory evaluations and analyses are performed on the wine tasters during wine certification in Portugal; however, even then, it does not fully account for personal preferences or biases [-@Cortez2009]. As such, it is difficult to account or correct for the subjectivity of human taste. This also means that it will be difficult for an algorithm to predict the quality of wine since patterns may not always be present or clear. Therefore, a lower accuracy score is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation in this method of predicting quality of wine based on chemical features is the fact that this data set only considers 11 features. In a 1978 study on wine quality, there were statistically significant correlations between the amounts of pigments in the wine and the perceived quality of the wine [@Jackson1978]. Pigments were not considered in the data set used in this project. These pigments may have some effect on the flavour but can also influence the appearance. It was not apparent whether or not the wine data was from a blind tasting or if visual indicators of quality were also considered, so there are additional factors that were not included within the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are several limitations to the methods used in this project, there may still be use for machine learning algorithms within the realm of predictions of wine quality. Primarily, it could still be useful in more targeted marketing techniques or finding ideal wines for more specific consumer groups. "
